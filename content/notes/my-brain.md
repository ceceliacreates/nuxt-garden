description: "notes about what works well for me and what doesn't with ADHD"

A few years ago my mom was diagnosed with ADHD. We have always been the same type of 'goofy', so after her diagnosis I looked more into the symptoms and found that ADHD is much different than I previously realized. While I have not pursued an official diagnosis, understanding how this type of brain works has helped me to identify some things that work well for me in being productive and working with my brain instead of against it. This is a collection of those notes.

## Understanding and appreciating wall work

I saw a video about why it's difficult for people with ADHD to initiate tasks. They talk about this waiting or prep period and describe it as "climbing the invisible wall". This is the time before starting something we're not particularly motivated to do when we feel 'frozen' or like we're 'procrastinating'. This time can include:

- Doing other, less-important tasks
- Walking through the steps of the task mentally
- Visualizing ourselves doing the task over and over
- Dreading the task
- Blanking out or disassociating 
- Distracting ourselves if we are dreading the task

I used to beat myself up a lot when I needed to initiate a task and spent time doing any or all of the above instead. Now, I think of this time as "wall work". This is just part of the task. Sure, other people many not need to do this step, but my brain does, and that's okay. And, there are some good things that come along with this.

For example, I find that because I have thought about the steps of the task and "practiced" them in my brain so much beforehand, I can usually execute tasks very quickly. Also, if I end up doing other tasks instead, then great! Those other tasks are now done.

Understanding this has been important in helping me better estimate how much time it takes to do something. I used to only count the time it took to actually execute the task. Like I mentioned before, this could be very fast! When I was a newspaper reporter, I could write a 600-word story in less than an hour when it was the end of the day and I was under deadline. However, this doesn't mean that a 600-word story will always only take an hour. I need to also remember to allocate "wall work" time, and -- most importantly -- not think of myself as unproductive or inefficient for needing that time.

## Understanding interest and motivation

Another aspect of ADHD and intiating tasks is that it can be very hard to start something when it's not interesting. For other brains, they are able to better translate the medium or long-term benefits of the task, and use that as motivation to start and complete it. The ADHD brain does not get the same good feels from longer-term rewards, so finding the motivation for these things can be difficult until they become "more" important (such as an urgent deadline or we find the topic intellectually interesting). 

So what do I do when I have a task I (logically) know is important, but have a hard time starting because there's not an immediate, urgent motivation or interest? I've found that gamification and tricking myself into starting small to work well here. It doesn't work all the time and takes some practice, but I will:

- **Tell myself to do just the first step of a task.** For example, if I have some dishes that need to be done, I tell myself I will just rinse out the cups and put those away. This feels like a quicker task with a smaller wall, but usually once I start, I tend to keep going and finish it. Most of the time, it only takes a few minutes more to finish and once I'm on a roll I breeze right through.
- **Alternative between two difficult tasks.** I used to try alternating between a difficult task and a fun one as "reward", but found it hard to break away from the fun task and go back. Whoops! Instead, I've found that if there are two things I don't want to do, I will spend some time on one until I lose focus, and then shift to another difficult task until I lose focus, then back to the first one again. I'm not sure why this works, but it helps me to push through some boring things while riding the good feels wave of being productive. It also helps me to see the progress I've made for each thing as motivation to go back and do more.
