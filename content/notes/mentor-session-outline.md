description: outline for one-hour intro mentoring session

If the mentee does not have a specific agenda, this can serve as an outline to guide a career discussion. Should be flexible.

## Intros (5 mins)

- Tell me about yourself! (Note how they talk about themselves, what they highlight, communication style how it could be improved, what they do well)
- About me, started out in journalism, then worked in financial services where I got my MBA and CAPM. First learned HTML and CSS in high school, made websites on the side over the years. Was thinking about a boot camp, started learning JavaScript on my own first and talked to other boot camp grads I met via WWC ATL. Decided to attend a full-time in-person boot camp, simultaneous boot camp and job search for three months. Had three offers upon graduation. Junior Software Developer at sports medicine company, then went to Cypress in 2022 to get back into working with customers. Speaking through WWC, then meetups and conferences. Just joined Replay.io this week!
