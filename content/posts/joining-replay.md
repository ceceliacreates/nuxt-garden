Today is my first day as Community Lead at Replay.io! 

I am incredibly excited about this new adventure for many reasons, but primarily because of Replay’s mission to make software easier to understand, more accessible, and more inclusive.

Replay is a time travel debugger that lets you record and replay web applications with familiar browser dev tools along for the ride. Replay lets you see what’s happening with your software at any point in time, add print statements to existing recordings, and share and comment for easy collaboration.

More than just being cool tech, Replay is built on a philosophy strongly aligned with my core values as a developer and community member.

Demystifying how applications work and what happens when they don’t work helps reduce the barrier to entry for software development. Creating a culture of sharing and working on bugs collaboratively reduces the fear and stigma around making “mistakes” with code.

I’m also so excited to focus more on community. Understanding developer challenges, building solutions and then sharing that knowledge with others has always been the most rewarding part of my professional and volunteer work. 

Through mentoring and volunteering with Out in Tech and Women Who Code, I’ve seen how a lack of support and unnecessary technical hurdles can prevent developers from thriving as they should. Creating approachable — even exciting! — developer experiences is necessary to fostering an inclusive industry where all developers can build software that goes on to power an inclusive world.

Replay does this by helping communities collaborate around a shared understanding of their software. The opportunity to focus full time on helping developers thrive with Replay is incredible, and I can’t wait to see the impact this will have on communities like these.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with me! If this mission resonates with you, I welcome you to join us in the [Replay Discord](https://replay.io/discord). We’d love to see how Replay can help your team or community. We all go farther when we go together, so let’s see how far we can go!
